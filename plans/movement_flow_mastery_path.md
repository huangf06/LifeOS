## Key Principles Throughout Your Journey

### The Four Cups - Keep Balanced:
- **Strength Cup** (50%): Build through holds and controlled movements
- **Flexibility Cup** (60%): Expand through daily stretching
- **Power Cup** (78%): Develop through dynamic transitions
- **Control Cup** (83%): Master through slow, precise practice

### The Three Ranges:
- **Weeks 1-4:** Safety Range (natural protection)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Peripheral Range (cautiously exploring limits)
- **Weeks 9-16:** Dynamic Range (smooth, controlled beyond limits)

### Small Details That Matter:
1. **Silence** - Your movements should be quiet (absorption principle)
2. **Pointed toes** - Creates lightness and control
3. **Eye guidance** - Where you look is where you go
4. **Palm rotation** - Softens angles, enables fluidity
5. **Absorption** - Roll through joints, distribute impact

---

## Daily Tracking & Reflection

**Weekly Check-In Questions:**
1. Which movements feel most natural?
2. Which movements need more attention?
3. Can I transition smoothly between X and Y?
4. How does my body feel? (energy, pain, freedom)
5. What creative variations did I discover?

**Monthly Video Review:**
- Record a 5-minute flow
- Watch without judgment
- Notice: smoothness, creativity, joy
- Celebrate progress!

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Safety First:**
- Use wall support for inversions initially
- Have pillows for forward rolls
- Practice on appropriate surfaces
- Listen to your body - rest when needed

🎯 **Quality Over Quantity:**
- Better to master one movement than rush through many
- Focus on the "how" not just the "what"
- Slow practice builds faster mastery

🌟 **Your Unique Expression:**
- Movement Flow is a framework, not a prescription
- Discover what feels good for YOUR body
- Creativity is the ultimate goal
